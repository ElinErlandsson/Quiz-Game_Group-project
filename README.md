# Quiz-Game_Group-project
A group project where we created a quiz game. We fetched questions and answers from an API, with three degrees of difficulty. You have a time of 60 seconds to answer all questions and after each answer you are delegated to the next question. When you have answered all the questions, you get to see how many correct answers you got and then save your points, where we used local storge.
